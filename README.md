Producing and launching a rocket is an expensive process, with most providers charging upwards of $165 million for each launch. However, SpaceX stands out by offering Falcon 9 rocket launches at a significantly lower cost of $62 million.

SpaceX achieves cost savings by implementing a reusable rocket design. They are able to reuse the first stage of their rockets, which is the lower part of the rocket that disconnects from the second stage containing the payload.

The successful landing of the first stage is crucial in determining the overall cost of a launch. By predicting whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully, valuable information can be obtained for a rival company that wishes to compete with SpaceX for a rocket launch contract.

In this project, our objective is to develop a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of a successful landing for the Falcon 9 first stage.
